      <p>Examination of performative and compositional ritual.</p>
      <p>Recognition of imposing vestigial western musical conventions.</p>
      <p>Removal:</p>
      <p>Intention, expectation, completion</p>
      <p>Notation of rhythm, pitch, form</p>
      <p>Requisite for validity resulting from labor</p>
      <p>Structure and formality</p>
      <p>Desire - Cultivation of a performative experience involving:</p>
      <p>Manufacture of creative impulse</p>
      <p>Observation of self and others</p>
      <p>Reinterpretation of borrowed elements:</p>
      <p>Graphic scores as visual prompts</p>
      <p>Text score as a codification of process</p>
      <p>Amorphous quality as a conduit to creative freedom.</p>

          any point in order to participate in the following:</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone will select a graphic score from a pile. They will set it on
        top, and whoever wants to participate will join them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person who selected the score will use numerical fingers to assign
        an order for the following process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1st player</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at the image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play an idea based on the creative impulse generated by the image. This
        idea should be conceived of as a suggestion and not developed by the
        performer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stop and listen to the next player.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2nd player</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not overlap with the previous player.
      </p>
      <p>
        Play your own ‚Äúsuggestion‚Äù based on the creative impulse generated by
        the image.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stop and listen to the next player.

        ...

          for a short moment.</strong

      <p>
        <strong
          >Using the sounded motives as a starting point, improvise as much or
          as little as you want.</strong

        ...

      <h3>
        Version 2 (solo)
      </h3>
      <p>
        Surround yourself with the graphic prompts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a situation where you can have a long period of time to process
        stream of consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        At your own disgretion, relate your ideas to the images.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you seek new ideas, find inspiration in the surrounding images.
