        When you hear it, stop playing and hum a comfortable tone for the
        duration of a long exhale.

        When you hear anyone begin to hum, stop playing and hum a [different]
        comfortable tone for the duration of a long exhale.

        At the end of the breath, wait for everyone to stop humming and sit in
