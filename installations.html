          Tuning as Material
        </h2>
        <p>
          The following is a description of an installation which played on a 24hour loop over the span of a week.
        </p>

      <p>
        ...
      </p>

        <p>
          The understanding of pitch is a product of memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, one can develop "perfect pitch" by remembering the distribution of equally tempered intervals 
        </p>
        <p>
          which are in fact a series of unnatural compromises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pianos also maintain a memory of pitch.
        </p>
        <p> 
          There are 15-20 tons of lateral tension from the strings and around 800 pounds of downward pressure on the soundboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pianos store this tension, among other things, in their physical structure as a memory,
        </p>
        <p>
          so when any difference in pitch is introduced to the entire keyboard,
        </p>
        <p> 
          the instrument spends the following days or weeks attempting to return itself to its remembered tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, the pitch will be slowly modulating‚Äîthe reinforced repetition of pitch is an illusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, thousands of microscopic gradations of each pitch class are being heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this installation, these microscopic gradations are evidenced by beat rates which begin to emerge as the pitch modulates,
        </p>
        <p>
          but the discrete changes in pitch in real time are not recognizable.
        </p>
        <p>
          In preparation for the week, I recorded onto the Disklavier an equal temperament aural tuning sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then retuned the piano in one pass to an unequal temperament which uses a chain of just-tuned intervals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Disklavier spends the week repeating the hour long equal temperament aural tuning sequence, thereby attempting to retune itself.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Because of the fact that the unequal temperament is tuned in one pass,
        </p>
        <p>
          the instrument attempted to retune itself over the course of the week to the original string tension of equal temperament.
        </p>
        <p> Archive 1 and Tuning 1 are from the beginning of the week immediately after retuning the instrument,
        </p>
        <p> and Archive 2 and Tuning 2 are at the end of the week.
        </p>
        <p> Archives 1 and 2 are a before and after documentation of the minor/major thirds and perfect fourths/fifths.
        </p>
        <p> Tuning 1 and 2 are a before and after documentation of the loop which was playing during the week of the installation. 
        </p>
