        For Six Strings in Fixed Tuning
      </h3>
      <p>
       The instrumentation for this piece is two violas, two cellos, and two basses. Below is a list of all
the possible retunings for each open string. The distribution of these is to be determined by the
group; however, all 12 pitch classes must be accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
       Each player will only have a portion of the 12 pitch classes. Below is a sequence to aid in
group tuning. *A and Ab are +/- 0 from equal temperament. The pitches are arranged to be
tuned left to right. Each measure represents a series of notes which are in tune with each other.
Black notes have already be tuned.
      </p>

       Determine a total length.

      <p>
       Each box represents a string or string combination. 
      </p>
      <p>
       Move between each box in any order, repeating as often as necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Notes should be held, but the duration is up to the player.
      </p>
      <p>
       The player can take as much or as little time between entrances as desired.
      </p>
      <p>
       When time is up, stop playing.

          Performance Instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          Play each cell as fast as possible. If it is difficult to play the cell fast, play at eighth note = 100bpm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cells can be performed in the order they are arranged, however it is fine to move through them in any order and for any duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page can be repeated identically or in different ways to achieve the desired length of the piece.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cells can be octave transposed within the range of C2-E5, as octaves or as tenths.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a cell is difficult to play, it can be practiced in a performative way by cycling through the various rhythms which are used to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small fermata can be placed on the last note of the cell. In this case, the cell should be played as a flourish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tuning instructions:
        </p>
        <p>
          Tune from C2-E4
        </p>
        <p>
          Mute every other string so that when you play octaves one note plays one string and the other plays multiple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tune the strings while playing the octave to achieve a microtonal pitch collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each octave should have at least three pitches sounding.
        </p>
