        For Six Strings in Fixed Tuning
      </h3>
      <p>
       The instrumentation for this piece is two violas, two cellos, and two basses. Below is a list of all
the possible retunings for each open string. The distribution of these is to be determined by the
group; however, all 12 pitch classes must be accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
       Each player will only have a portion of the 12 pitch classes. Below is a sequence to aid in
group tuning. *A and Ab are +/- 0 from equal temperament. The pitches are arranged to be
tuned left to right. Each measure represents a series of notes which are in tune with each other.
Black notes have already be tuned.
