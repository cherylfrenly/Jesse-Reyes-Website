        For Six Strings in Fixed Tuning
      </h3>
      <p>
       The instrumentation for this piece is two violas, two cellos, and two basses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a list of all the possible retunings for each open string. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The distribution of these is to be determined by the group; 
      </p>
      <p>
        however, all 12 pitch classes must be accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each player will only have a portion of the 12 pitch classes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a sequence to aid in group tuning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        *A and Ab are +/- 0 from equal temperament. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The pitches are arranged to be tuned left to right. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each measure represents a series of notes which are in tune with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black notes have already be tuned.
      </p>

       Each box represents a string or string combination.

       Move between each box in any order, repeating as often as necessary.

      <p>
       Notes should be held, but the duration is up to the player.
      </p>
      <p>
       The player can take as much or as little time between entrances as desired.

      <p>
       When time is up, stop playing.

          <strong>Tuning instructions:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Tune from C2-E5
        </p>
        <p>
          Strip mute every other white key so that when you play octaves one note plays one string and the other plays multiple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tune the strings while playing the octave to achieve a microtonal pitch collection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each octave should have at least three pitches sounding.
        </p>

        <p> 
          <strong>Performance Instructions:</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Play each cell as fast as possible. If it is difficult to play the cell fast, play more slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page can be repeated as written or in different ways to achieve the desired length of the piece.
        </p>
        <p>
         Each cell can be played in octaves or with the right hand a M10 above the left.
        </p>
        <p>
         This can be done in any octave within the range of C2-E5.
        <p>
          If a cell is difficult to play, it can be practiced while performing by cycling through the various rhythms which are used to practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last pitch of the cell can be held for a duration equal to the total length of the rest of the notes in the cell.
        </p>

          For Quarter Tone Pianos
        </p>
        <p> 
          Dots are arranged as four phrases and should be read from left to right --
        </p>
        <p>
          the first phrase being at the top and the last at the bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dots represent the general density of the two pianos and should not be scrutinized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pianos use the three chords on the left as material,
        </p>
        <p>
          played and repeated in a randomized order to achieve the density represented in each phrase.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use a stopwatch and start the first phrase at 00:00.
        </p>
        <p>
          Move through the first phrase and reach the end at 0:45.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pause.
        </p>
        <p>
          At 0:50, play the excerpt on the right as written.
        </p>
        <p>
          Start the next phrase at 1:00.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continue this pattern until the stopwatch hits 4:00.
        </p>
        <p>
          The higher piano plays the excerpt on the right for phrases 1 and 3,
        </p>
        <p>
          and the lower piano plays the excerpt on the right for phrases 2 and 4.
