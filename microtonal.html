        For Six Strings in Fixed Tuning
      </h3>
      <p>
       The instrumentation for this piece is two violas, two cellos, and two basses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a list of all the possible retunings for each open string. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The distribution of these is to be determined by the group; 
      </p>
      <p>
        however, all 12 pitch classes must be accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each player will only have a portion of the 12 pitch classes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Below is a sequence to aid in group tuning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        *A and Ab are +/- 0 from equal temperament. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The pitches are arranged to be tuned left to right. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each measure represents a series of notes which are in tune with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Black notes have already be tuned.
      </p>

       <strong>Performance Instructions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
       Determine a total length based on what is physically comfortable.
      </p>
      <p>
       Each box represents a string or string combination. 
      </p>

     <div class="boxes">
     <div class="box">1</div>
     <div class="box">2</div>
     <div class="box">3</div>
     <div class="box">4</div>
     <div class="box">1+2</div>
     <div class="box">2+3</div>
     <div class="box">3+4</div>
     </div>

<p>
Cycle through the different string combinations in each box 
</p>
<p>
in any order, random or premeditated, 
</p>
<p>
as many times as the determined length permits. 
</p>
<p>
The length of each box and rate of change is also up to the player, 
</p>
<p>
however the bowing should be constant for the entire piece.
</p>

      <p><strong>Tuning instructions:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Strip mute the following notes so that only one string is left unmuted:
      </p>
      <p><strong>D2, F2, A2, C3, E3, G3.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This will result in two or more strings of the following notes being unmuted.
      </p>
      <p><strong>C2, E2, G2, D3, F3, A3.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>This will result in octaves which produce three or more pitches, which are represented as vertical pairs.
      </p>
      <p>[Horizontally] the top row is a list of keys which produce one pitch and the bottom row is a list of keys which produce two or more. 
      </p>
      <p><strong>C3, E3, G3,        D2, F2, A2</strong>
      </p>
      <p><strong>C2, E2, G2,        D3, F3, A3</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Tune each vertical row.
      </p>
      <p>The tuning should use a mix of just and beating intervals to achieve a pitch cloud for each vertical row.
      </>
      <p><strong>Performance Instructions:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>Play the first five octaves of the first measure of The Virtuoso Pianist by Charles-Louis Hanon as fast as possible. 
      </p>
      <p>The fifth octave should be held for a duration equal to the total length of the first four octaves.
      </p>
      <p>Repeat.
      </p>

        <p> 
          Dots are arranged as four phrases and should be read from left to right.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first phrase is at the top and the last at the bottom.

        <p>
          The dots represent the general density of the two pianos and should not be scrutinized.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pianos use the following three chords as material,
        </p>
        <p>
          played and repeated in a randomized order to achieve the density represented in each phrase.

          Use a stopwatch and start the first phrase at 00:00.

          Move through the first phrase and reach the end at 0:45.

          Pause.

          Start the next phrase at 1:00.

          Continue this pattern until the stopwatch hits 4:00.
        </p>
        <p>
          The higher piano plays the aforementioned excerpt at the ends of phrases 1 and 3,

        <p>
          and the lower piano plays the same excerpt at the ends of phrases 2 and 4.
