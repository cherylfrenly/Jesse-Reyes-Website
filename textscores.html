      <p>Make a quiet sound that is soothing.</p>
      <p>The total length of a sound should not exceed 5 seconds.

        When you hear anyone begin to hum, stop playing and hum a [different]

        Inhale, Exhale
      </h3>
<p>
Sit huddled in a circle, heads touching.
</p>
<p>
The group begins by producing a comfortable and soft tone.
</p>
<p>
Clockwise, one at time:
</p>
<p>
Taper off the tone so that the entrance goes unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
Inhale sharply and loudly through pursed lips.
</p>
<p>
Enter immediately with a tapered tone so that the entrance goes unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
<em>Shift the pitch slightly for every entrance.</em>
</p>
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perform this piece for as long as is safe.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The pacing of breathing will determine the size of the circle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the circle is too large, there will be too much time between breaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the circle is too small, the entrances and exits will be too noticable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This piece can be performed by a large ensemble if it is divided into several small groups.</em>
