      <h3>Humming</h3>  
      <p>Listen to your surroundings. This is the main action of the participant.</p>
      <p>Contribute a quiet sound that is soothing and relaxing to produce.</p>
      <p>The total length of a sound should not exceed 5 seconds.</p>
      <p>Listen more than you play.</p>
      <p>Make another contribution.</p>
      <p>Continue listening. Continue contributing sounds.</p>
      <p>...</p>
      <p>
        Continue this process until you hear a sound which produces a chill in the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you feel it, stop playing and hum a comfortable tone for the
        duration of a comfortably long exhale.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hum based soley on what is physically comfortable, without considering pitch.
      </p>  
      <p>
        When you finish, wait for everyone to stop humming and sit in
        the resulting silence for an extended moment.

      <h3>
        Inhale, Exhale
      </h3>
<p>
Sit huddled in a circle.
</p>
<p>
The group begins by producing a held soft tone
</p>
<p>  
based soley on what is physically comfortable,
</p
<p>
without considerating pitch.
</p>  
<p>
Clockwise, one at a time, each person completes the following three tasks:
</p>
<p>
(1) Taper off the tone so that the decay goes unnoticed, then immediately
</p>
<p>
(2) inhale sharply and loudly through pursed lips, then immediately
</p>
<p>
(3) produce a tapered tone so that the entrance goes unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
Shift the pitch slightly for every entrance.
</p>
<p>
The result should be a held chord and a pulse of breath which acts as a metronome.
</p>  
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Perform this piece for as long as is safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pacing of breathing will determine the size of the circle. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If the circle is too large, there will be too much time between breaths.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the circle is too small, the entrances and exits will be too noticable.
      </p>
      <p>
        This piece can be performed by a large ensemble if it is divided into several small groups.
