        <ul>
          <li>Please wear a mask while we are near each other.</li>
          <li>
            If possible, please open doors or windows to help ventilate the
            room.
          </li>
          <li>Try to maintain 6 feet of distance at all times.</li>

          <li>
            If you or anyone in your household is experiencing symptoms, please
            reschedule your appointment.
          </li>
          <li>
            If this results in a last-minute cancellation there is no associated
            fee.
          </li>

          <li>
            If you or a family member test positive before or immediately after
            the appointment, please notify me.
          </li>
          <li>
            Please remove any objects from on top of the piano so that I am
            touching as few things in your household as possible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Thank you, your consideration is greatly appreciated!
